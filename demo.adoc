= Secure Chat with Socket.IO and React Demo Steps

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple chat application using Socket.IO, React for the front-end, and Node/Express for the back-end.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://nodejs.org/[Node 14]
- An https://developer.okta.com[Okta Developer] Account (or the https://cli.okta.com/[Okta CLI])

TIP: The brackets at the end of some steps indicate the IntelliJ Live Templates to use. You can find the template definitions at https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates[mraible/idea-live-templates]. You can also find the source code in the blog post and GitHub repo.

== Create a Chat Server with Express and Socket.IO

. First, implement the server by using the following command to create a chat server project

  npx express-generator --no-view chat-server

. Navigate into the `chat-server` folder and install the Socket.IO and other dependencies

  npm install
  npm install -E @socket.io4.4.0 uuid@8.3.2 cors@2.8.5

. Create `chat-server/chat.js` to configure the chat server [`chat-server`]

. To use the `chat` module, open `bin/www` and add the following two imports at the top
+
[source,javascript]
----
var chat = require('../chat');
var socketio = require('socket.io');
----

. Modify the section under the comment `Create HTTP Server` to look like the code below
+
[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * Create HTTP server.
 */

var server = http.createServer(app);
var io = socketio(server,{
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST']
  }
});
chat(io);
----

. Finally, you need to add CORS support to the Express server. Open `app.js` and add the `cors` import to the top of the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var cors = require('cors');
----
+
Then, add the `cors` middleware to the Express server
+
[source,javascript]
----
var app = express();
app.use(cors()); // add this line
----

. Start the server

  npm start

== Implement a Socket.IO Client Using React

. Use Create React App to create a new React application

  npx create-react-app chat-client
+
CAUTION: If you get an error about `create-react-app` 4.0.3, run `npx clear-npx-cache`

. Navigate into the `chat-client` folder and install the Socket.IO client library

  npm install -E socket.io-client@4.4.0

. Open `src/App.js` and configure a connection to the server using Socket.IO [`chat-app`]

. Give the component some styling in `src/App.css` [`chat-app-css`]

. Create `src/Messages.js` to display messages sorted by the timestamp at which they were created [`chat-messages`]

. Add some styling in `src/Messages.css` [`chat-messages-css`]

. Create `src/MessageInput.js` to host a text input you can use to send messages [`chat-input`]

. Add CSS styling by creating a new `src/MessageInput.css` file [`chat-input-css`]

. Your client is now complete! However, both the server and the client use port 3000 by default. To change the port for the client, create a `.env` file in your client project folder and copy the following line into it.

  PORT=8080

. Now you can start the client

  npm start

All messages will appear to be written by Anonymous and not by the current user. You can add identity with Okta to fix this.

== Add User Authentication with OpenID Connect

. Install the https://cli.okta.com/[Okta CLI] and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`.

. Run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose *Single-Page App* and press *Enter*.

. Use `\http://localhost:8080/login/callback` for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to `\http://localhost:8080`.

. You will also need to generate a token so that your chat server can communicate with the Okta authentication service. Run `okta login`, open the resulting URL in your browser, sign-in, and navigate to *Security* > *API*.
+
Navigate to *Tokens* > *Create Token* and type in a name for the token. Copy the token to a secure place; you will need it later.

=== Add Okta to the Socket.IO Chat Server

. The next step is to add Okta to the server of the chat application. Install Okta's JWT Verifier and Node SDK in the `chat-server` project.

  npm install -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0 @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@6.1.0

. Open `chat.js` and add an `authHandler()` just after the imports [`chat-auth-server`]

. To use the authentication handler, tell Socket.IO to use it whenever a connection from the client is requested.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function chat(io) {
  io.use(authHandler);
  ..
}
----

. Start the server

  npm start

Now that you have added Okta to the server, add it to the client as well.

=== Add Okta to the Socket.IO Client

. Install Okta's React SDK and React Router in the `chat-client` project

  npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.3.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.9.1 \
    react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.3.0

. Since the app is already configured to use a `.env` file, add your Okta settings

  REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaDomain}
  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
+
Any definitions starting with `REACT_APP_` will become available in the client code through the `process.env` global

. Open `src/index.js` and add Okta configuration and routes [`chat-auth-react`]

. Next, update `ReactDOM.render()` to use secure routes
+
[source,jsx]
----
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router>
      <SecuredRoutes />
    </Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
----

. Then, create a `src/auth.js` file to setup authentication and its state [`chat-auth-client`]

. The function `useAuth()` will be used as a React hook in the main application component to set the user information and the JWT token value. Open `App.js` and import the handler at the top of the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { useAuth } from './auth';
----

. At the start of the `App()` function, set the user information and token [`chat-auth-hook`]

. Now, modify the `useEffect()` hook to send the token when connecting to the server
+
[source,javascript]
----
useEffect(() => {
    const newSocket = io(`...`, token && { query: { token } });
    ...
  }, [setSocket, token]);
----

. Finally, replace the `<header>` with code the renders the appropriate buttons based on the user's authentication state [`chat-auth-header`]

. Start the client to see it all working! You can create another user in Okta (*Directory* > *People*) to simulate a chat between multiple people.

  npm start

üéâ Congratulations, you created a simple real-time chat application!
