= Secure Chat with Socket.IO and React Demo Steps

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple chat application using Socket.IO, React for the front-end, and Node/Express for the back-end.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://nodejs.org/[Node 14]
- An https://developer.okta.com[Okta Developer] Account (or the https://cli.okta.com/[Okta CLI])

TIP: The brackets at the end of some steps indicate the IntelliJ Live Templates to use. You can find the template definitions at https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates[mraible/idea-live-templates]. You can also find the source code in the blog post and GitHub repo.

== Create a Chat Server with Express and Socket.IO

. First, implement the server by using the following command to create a chat server project

  npx express-generator --no-view chat-server

. Navigate into the `chat-server` folder and install the Socket.IO and other dependencies

  npm install
  npm install -E socket.io@4.1.2 uuid@8.3.2 cors@2.8.5

. Create a `chat-server/chat.js` file [`chat-server`]

. To use the chat module, open `bin/www` and add the following two imports at the top
+
[source,javascript]
----
var chat = require('../chat');
var socketio = require('socket.io');
----

. Modify the section under the comment `Create HTTP Server` to look like the code below
+
[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * Create HTTP server.
 */

var server = http.createServer(app);
var io = socketio(server,{
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST']
  }
});
chat(io);
----

. Finally, you need to add CORS support to the Express server. Open `app.js` and add the `cors` import to the top of the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var cors = require('cors');
----
+
Then, add the `cors` middleware to the Express server
+
[source,javascript]
----
var app = express();
app.use(cors()); // add this line
----

. Start the server

  npm start

== Implement the Socket.IO Client Using React

. Use Create React App to create a new React application

  npx create-react-app chat-client

. Navigate into the `chat-client` folder and install the Socket.IO client library

  npm install -E socket.io-client@4.1.2

. Open `src/App.js` and replace its contents [`chat-app`]

. Give the component some styling in `src/App.css` [`chat-app-css`]

. Create `src/Messages.js` to handle messages [`chat-messages`]

. Add some styling in `src/Messages.css` [`chat-messages-css`]

. Create `src/MessageInput.js` to host a text input you can use to send messages [`chat-input`]

. Add CSS styling by creating a new `src/MessageInput.css` file [`chat-input-css`]

. Your client is now complete! However, both the server and the client use port 3000 by default. To change the port for the client, create a `.env` file in your client project folder and copy the following line into it.

  PORT=8080

. Now you can start the client

  npm start

All messages will appear to be written by Anonymous and not by the current user. Adding authentication can fix this.

== Add User Authentication with OpenID Connect

. Install the https://cli.okta.com/[Okta CLI] and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`.

. Run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose *Single-Page App* and press *Enter*.

. Use `http://localhost:8080/login/callback` for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080`.

. You will also need to generate a token so that your chat server can communicate with the Okta authentication service. Run `okta login`, open the resulting URL in your browser, sign-in, and navigate to *Security* > *API*.
+
Navigate to *Tokens* > *Create Token* and type in a name for the token. Copy the token to a secure place; you will need it later.

=== Add Okta to the Socket.IO Chat Server

. The next step is to add user management with Okta to the server of the chat application. Install Okta's JWT Verifier and Node SDK in the `chat-server` project.

  npm install -E @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0 @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@6.1.0

. Open `chat.js` and add an `authHandler()` just after the imports [`chat-auth-server`]

. To use the authentication handler, tell Socket.IO to use the authentication handler whenever a connection from the client is requested.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function chat(io) {
  io.use(authHandler);
  ..
}
----

. Now that you have added user management to the server, it is time to add it to the client as well.

=== Add Okta to the Socket.IO Client

. Install Okta's React SDK and React Router in the `chat-client` project

  npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.3.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.9.1 react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.3.0

. Since the app is already configured to use a `.env` file, add your Okta settings

  REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaDomain}
  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
+
Any definitions starting with `REACT_APP_` will become available in the client code through the `process.env` global

. Open `src/index.js` and add Okta configuration and routes [`chat-auth-react`]

. Next, replace the call to ReactDOM.render() with the code below
+
[source,javascript]
----
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router>
      <SecuredRoutes />
    </Router>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
----

. Then, create a `src/auth.js` file to setup authentication and its state [`chat-auth-client`]

. The function `useAuth()` will be used as a React hook in the main application component to set the user information and the JWT token value. Now, open `App.js` and import the handler at the top of the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { useAuth } from './auth';
----

. At the start of the `App()` function, set the user information and token [`chat-auth-hook`]

. Now, modify the `useEffect()` hook to send the token when connecting to the server
+
[source,javascript]
----
useEffect(() => {
    const newSocket = io(`http://${window.location.hostname}:3000`, token && { query: { token } });
    setSocket(newSocket);
    return () => newSocket.close();
  }, [setSocket, token]);
----

. Finally, replace the `<header>` with code the renders the appropriate buttons based on the user's authentication state [`chat-auth-header`]

. Start the client to see it all working!

  npm start

üéâ Congratulations, you created a simple real-time chat application!
